            <p >ELISA plate data may be processed
                from this page.
                For the
                data to be processed, a F007 file and raw data files are
                required. F007 contains the testing details. The raw data files
                are expected to be exported from Omega MARS software with
                the ICH template applied. If any of the expected files are
                missing or if the files do not contain all the
                required information, the operation will either stop or
                ignore that file.

            </p>
            <p><img src="./images/elisa-data.png" alt="elisa-main"></p>
            <ol>
                <li>Browse to find relevant F007</li>
                <li>Browse to find and select raw MARS files</li>
                <li> Select from a list of presets
                    (Clinical/Validation/Custom)</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For the validated (Clinical) ELISA assay, the
                            OD limits and LLOQ will be disabled as these
                            must be kept.</li>
                        <li>For assay validation, the upper OD limit will
                            be applied and disabled for editing. LLOQ and the
                            lower OD limit of 0.1 will be available for
                            editing but will default to being 'off'</li>
                        <li>There is a custom option from the dropdown

                <li>Type in an upper and/or lower OD limit. Uncheck the
                    checkboxes to remove either or both OD limits.

                </li>
                <li>Applying LLOQ will assign an arbritrary "<0.15" value
                    to those samples below the LLOQ. Removing this
                    function will treat the sample like any other.

            <header>
                <h4>Error Tab</h4>
            </header>
            <p>This tab contains an error logger which will display a list
                of errors that may occur during execution. Some errors will
            be explicitly handled, while others may not. The image below
                illustrates this:</p>
            <p><img src="./images/elisa-errors.png" alt="elisa-error"></p>
            <p>Error 1 has been handled within the code, and a
                simple error message is presented. In this case, the
                trending file cannot be found. The file path to the
                trending file should be checked in the <a href="#file-paths">
                    file paths</a> settings page</p>
            <p>Error 2 has not been handled from within the code. Instead,
                the exception raised from within Python is re-routed to the
                error log and displayed here. The error may not be as
                intuitive. In this case, an error was forced by trying to
                append a number to the text box.</p>
            <p>In the case of an unhandled exception where it is not clear
                how to proceed, the error log may be saved (3) as a text
                file.</p>
        </section>

        <header>
            <h3 id="output-data">Output Data Files</h3>
        </header>
        <section>
            <p>There are a number of output files produced/updated during
                ELISA data processing. There are two main save locations for these files:
            <ol>
                <li>Assay Directory (where plate data are stored)</li>
                <li>Study Master Directory (where all master files are stored)</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <header>
                <h4>Run details (assay directory)</h4>
                <p>
                    This table contains information about the assay:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Master file study path</li>
                        <li>Assay details (date, technician study...)</li>
                        <li>Number of plates run and number failed</li>
                        <li>Any warnings for particular plates/samples</li>
                        <li>Plate and sample details</li>
                    </ul>
                    Plate warnings typically involve some issue with the input data. For example, if the
                    template is not applied during plate reading or if the plate was read on the wrong protocol.
                    When warnings are addressed and data is re-processed, they will disappear from the
                    run_details file. Sample warnings will typically result from an empty sample (too high/low).
                </p>
                <h4>F093 (assay directory)</h4>
                <p>
                    F093 is a summary table of results saved as a <em>.xlsm</em> file. Two tables are included.
                    The first table is protected and the second table is for editing. This is to allow for a comparison
                    between the original and altered results (typically due to high/low/missing values)
                </p>
                <h4>F093 json file (assay directory)</h4>
                <p>
                    If plates are processed in batches or the same plate is processed multiple times, the F093 will need
                    to be updated automatically to reflect the new results. This is done through the use of this
                    <em>.json</em> file. It keeps track of new and existing data and is used to update F093 accordingly.
                </p>
                <h4>Master Study File (study master directory)</h4>
                <p>
                    This csv file contains a result for every single sample tested throughout a study (that has been
                    processed using the application). This can be used for throughput summaries, cross-referencing and
                    quick data-lookups. Primarily it will be compared to the results obtained from manual input before
                    sending results to sponsors. The layout of the file is self explanatory but it is worth mentioning
                    the amended result column. The results that will appear in this column will either indicate high
                    or low sample results that cannot be calculated or 'NR' == 'No Result'. This will appear if the same
                    sample has previously been tested against the same serotype and returned an 'NP' == 'Non Parallel'
                    on both occasions.
                </p>
                <p><img src="images/master.png"></p>

                <h4>Trending File (directory specified in settings)</h4>
                <p>
                    This csv file contains the QC results obtained from each plate processed using the application.
                    Trending results prior to this have been re-formatted and included in this file.

                A Gantt chart can be produced to help keep track of projects. For this to be possible, the application
                needs a list of projects with the following column names:
                <ul>
                <li>sponsor <em>required</em> </li>
                <li>study <em>required</em> </li>
                <li>shipment (shipment number) <em>required</em></li>
                <li>start (Day expected to start testing) <em>required</em></li>
                <li>end (Day expected to finish testing) <em>required</em></li>
                <li>n (Number of samples) <em>required</em></li>
                <li>pn (Number of serotypes) <em>optional</em></li>
                <li>total (Total number of results) <em>optional</em></li>
                <li>Tested (Number of results obtained) <em>optional</em></li>
                <li>perc_com (Percentage complete) <em>required</em></li>
                <li>deadline (Add a deadline to Gantt chart) <em>optional</em></li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>The following options are available on the page:
            <ul>
                <li>Start/End date - select a date range to display (x-axis)</li>
                <li>Plot button - plot the chart</li>
                <li>Save button - save the plot to .png</li></lis>

                There are a number of files and directories required for the application to run. As some of these files
                may need to be edited in the future, they are not included as resources within the application itself,
                rather, the file paths need to be specified for reading/writing. Any error that may occur during
                execution where the error log reports that a file was not found may be solved by checking and editing
                the file paths on this page.
